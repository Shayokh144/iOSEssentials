### State
A state is a condition or situation during the life of an object during which it satisfies some condition, performs some activity, or waits for some event.


### Event
An event is the specification of a significant occurrence that has a location in time and space. In the context of state machines, an event is an occurrence of a stimulus that can trigger a state transition.

A guard condition is evaluated after the trigger event for the transition occurs. It is possible to have multiple transitions from the same source state and with the same event trigger, as long as the guard conditions donâ€™t overlap. A guard condition is evaluated just once for the transition at the time the event occurs. The boolean expression may reference the state of the object.

### Transition
A transition is a relationship between two states indicating that an object in the first state will perform certain actions and enter the second state when a specified event occurs and specified conditions are satisfied. Activity is an ongoing non-atomic execution within a state machine.

### Action
An action is an executable atomic computation that results in a change in the state of the model or the return of a value.


### Relationships

#### Associations	
- Indicate that instances of one model element are connected to instances of another model element
- Example: 
	- 1..1: Only one
	- 0..*: Zero or more
	- 1..*:one or more
#### Dependencies	
- Indicate that a change to one model element can affect another model element
#### Generalizations	
- Indicate that one model element is a specialization of another model element
#### Realization / Implementation	
- Indicate that one model element provides a specification that another model element implements

### Class Diagram

The UML Class diagram is a graphical notation used to construct and visualize object oriented systems. A class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's:

- classes,
- their attributes,
- operations (or methods),
- and the relationships among objects.

#### When do we need Class Diagram

-  Class diagrams provide a visual representation of the structure of a system, showing the classes, attributes, operations, and relationships between them. This visual representation helps stakeholders understand the architecture and design of the system more easily.


- Class diagrams serve as a means of communication between different stakeholders such as developers, designers, testers, and business analysts. They provide a common language and visual representation that can be easily understood by everyone involved in the project.

- Class diagrams can reveal recurring patterns in the system design, such as inheritance, aggregation, association, and composition. Recognizing these patterns can lead to more efficient and reusable designs.

-  By visually representing the relationships and dependencies between classes, class diagrams can help in identifying potential errors or inconsistencies in the design early in the development process, before implementation begins.

- In the design phase, class diagrams are used to model the structural aspects of the system. They help in designing the class hierarchy, defining the attributes and methods of each class, and specifying the relationships between classes such as associations, aggregations, and inheritances.

- UML class diagrams serve as a means of communication between different stakeholders involved in the project, including developers, designers, testers, and business analysts. They provide a common visual language that can be easily understood by everyone, facilitating effective communication and collaboration.

- In some cases, class diagrams can be used to generate code automatically. Tools that support Model-Driven Development (MDD) can take UML diagrams, including class diagrams, and generate code in various programming languages, which can significantly speed up the development process.


#### Main components of class diagram

- Class: Represents a template or blueprint for objects. It consists of a name, attributes, and operations/methods.

- Attributes: Describes the properties or characteristics of a class. Attributes are usually depicted as name: type pairs. For example, "name: String".

- Operations/Methods: Represents the behavior or actions that objects of the class can perform. Operations are usually depicted as name(parameters): return type. For example, "calculatePrice(quantity: int): double".

- Visibility: Denotes the visibility or access level of attributes and methods. Common visibility modifiers include public (+), private (-), protected (#), and package (~).

- Relationships:

	- Association: Represents a relationship between two classes, indicating that objects of one class are connected to objects of another class. Associations can have multiplicities (e.g., 1..*).
	- Aggregation: Denotes a "whole-part" relationship between classes, where one class (the whole) contains or is composed of instances of another class (the part). Aggregation is depicted using a diamond-shaped hollow arrowhead.
	- Composition: Similar to aggregation but with stronger ownership semantics. In composition, the part class is dependent on the whole class, and the part cannot exist without the whole. Composition is depicted using a solid diamond-shaped arrowhead.
	- Inheritance/Generalization: Represents an "is-a" relationship between classes, where one class (subclass or child) inherits attributes and operations from another class (superclass or parent). Inheritance is depicted using a solid line with a hollow arrowhead pointing from the subclass to the superclass.
	- Realization/Implementation: Denotes a relationship between a class and an interface or abstract class, indicating that the class implements the behavior specified by the interface or abstract class. Realization is depicted using a dashed line with a hollow arrowhead pointing from the implementing class to the interface or abstract class.
- Multiplicity: Represents the cardinality or number of instances participating in a relationship. Multiplicity is specified using numerical values or symbols such as "", "0..1", "1..", etc.

- Dependency: Denotes a relationship where one class depends on another class in some way. Dependencies can be depicted using dashed lines with an arrowhead pointing from the dependent class to the independent class.

### Component Diagram


UML Component diagrams are useful when you need to illustrate the components of a system and their dependencies, interactions, and relationships at a higher level of abstraction. They are particularly helpful in the following scenarios:


#### When do we need Component Diagram

- System Architecture Design: Component diagrams are used to model the high-level structure of a system, showing the various components that make up the system and how they interact with each other. This is especially valuable during the initial design phase of a software project to establish the overall architecture.
- Component-Based Development: In systems built using a component-based approach, where software is composed of reusable and interchangeable components, component diagrams help in visualizing these components and their relationships. This is common in distributed systems, service-oriented architectures (SOA), and microservices architectures.
- Dependency Management: Component diagrams can depict the dependencies between different components of a system, including both static and dynamic dependencies. This helps in understanding how changes to one component may impact other components, aiding in dependency management and modularization.
- System Integration: When integrating multiple subsystems or external components into a larger system, component diagrams provide a clear representation of the interfaces and interactions between these components. This facilitates the integration process by identifying potential points of integration and communication.
- Documentation: Component diagrams serve as a form of documentation for the system architecture, providing a visual overview of the components, their relationships, and their interactions. This documentation is valuable for communication among team members, as well as for onboarding new developers and stakeholders.
- Deployment Planning: Component diagrams can also be used to model the deployment of components onto physical or virtual hardware infrastructure. This includes specifying the deployment units, their locations, and the communication paths between them. It helps in planning the deployment strategy and ensuring scalability, reliability, and performance.
- System Maintenance and Refactoring: During system maintenance or refactoring efforts, component diagrams aid in understanding the existing architecture and identifying areas for improvement or optimization. They help in analyzing the impact of changes on different components and guiding the restructuring of the system.

They allow for the addition, modification, or removal of use cases based on changing requirements and feedback from users.


#### Main components of UseCase diagram

- **Use Case:** Represents a specific goal, task, or functionality that a system provides to its users (actors). Use cases describe the interactions between the system and its users and capture the system's behavior from the user's perspective. Each use case represents a discrete unit of functionality that delivers value to the user.

- **Actor:** Represents a role played by a user, external system, or entity that interacts with the system to achieve a specific goal or perform a specific task. Actors are external to the system and interact with the system by initiating and participating in use cases. They are connected to use cases through associations.

- **System Boundary:** Represents the boundary of the system under consideration in the Use Case diagram. It delineates the scope of the system and defines the context in which the use cases and actors operate. The system boundary encloses all the use cases and actors relevant to the system being modeled.

### Sequence Diagram

UML Sequence Diagrams are interaction diagrams that detail how operations are carried out. They capture the interaction between objects in the context of a collaboration. Sequence Diagrams are time focus and they show the order of the interaction visually by using the vertical axis of the diagram to represent time what messages are sent and when. They are particularly helpful in the following scenarios:

#### When do we need Sequence Diagram

- Behavioral Modeling: Sequence diagrams are commonly used to model the dynamic behavior of a system by illustrating the sequence of messages exchanged between objects or components during the execution of a use case or scenario. They provide insights into how objects collaborate and interact to achieve a particular functionality.

- **Object:** Represents an instance of a class or component within the system being modeled. Objects are depicted as rectangles with the name of the object inside. They participate in sequence diagrams by sending and receiving messages to and from other objects.

- **Lifeline:** Represents the existence of an object over a period of time within the sequence diagram. Lifelines are depicted as vertical dashed lines extending from the top to the bottom of the diagram, with the object's name or reference at the top.

- **Message:** Represents a communication or interaction between objects in the sequence diagram. Messages are depicted as arrows that flow between lifelines, indicating the flow of control or data between objects. Messages can be synchronous (denoted by a solid arrow), asynchronous (denoted by an open arrow), or self-referential (loop arrow).

- **Activation:** Represents the period of time during which an object is actively processing or executing a message. Activations are depicted as narrow rectangles or bars along the lifeline, indicating when the object is processing the message and when it is idle.

- **Return Message:** Represents a response or return value sent by an object in response to a message received from another object. Return messages are depicted as dashed arrows flowing back along the lifeline from the receiving object to the sending object.

#### Main components of State diagram

- **State:** Represents a condition or situation in the behavior of a system. States represent the different modes or configurations in which the system can exist at any given time. Each state defines a specific set of behaviors or actions that the system performs while in that state.

- **Transition:** Represents a change of state in response to an event or condition. Transitions specify the conditions under which a state change occurs and the actions or behaviors that are triggered as a result of the transition. Transitions are depicted as arrows between states and are labeled with the triggering event or condition.

- **Initial State:** Represents the starting point of the state diagram, indicating the initial state of the system when it first enters the diagram. The initial state is depicted as a filled circle with an incoming arrow and is labeled with the name of the initial state.

- **Final State:** Represents the end point of the state diagram, indicating the final state of the system when it exits the diagram. The final state is depicted as a filled circle with no outgoing transitions and is labeled with the name of the final state.

- **Event:** Represents an occurrence or happening that triggers a state transition. Events can be internal or external to the system and can include user actions, system inputs, environmental changes, or timer expirations. Events are associated with transitions and specify the conditions under which a transition occurs.

- **Guard Condition:** Represents a Boolean expression that must be satisfied for a transition to occur. Guard conditions specify additional constraints or criteria that must be met before a transition can take place. Guard conditions are associated with transitions and are evaluated when the transition is triggered by an event.

- **Action:** Represents a behavior or activity that occurs in response to a state transition. Actions specify the operations or tasks that are performed when a transition occurs and can include updates to internal data, interactions with external systems, or changes to the system's behavior. Actions are associated with transitions and are executed when the transition is triggered by an event.
