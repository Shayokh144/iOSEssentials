# UML

## Structural Modeling
- Related to things(concrete or concptual)
- Usually refer to Noun

### Structural Modeling Diagram Types

- Class
- Component(Plugable and Replaceble piece of Software)
- Package
- Deployment


## Behavioral Modeling
- Related to functionality
- Usually refer to Verb

### Behavioral Modeling Diagram Types

- Use Case
- Sequence
- State
- Activity


### Message types

- [Types](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/interaction-message.html)
- Need to write function names over the line

- Return message

### State
A state is a condition or situation during the life of an object during which it satisfies some condition, performs some activity, or waits for some event.


### Event
An event is the specification of a significant occurrence that has a location in time and space. In the context of state machines, an event is an occurrence of a stimulus that can trigger a state transition.

A guard condition is evaluated after the trigger event for the transition occurs. It is possible to have multiple transitions from the same source state and with the same event trigger, as long as the guard conditions donâ€™t overlap. A guard condition is evaluated just once for the transition at the time the event occurs. The boolean expression may reference the state of the object.

### Transition
A transition is a relationship between two states indicating that an object in the first state will perform certain actions and enter the second state when a specified event occurs and specified conditions are satisfied. Activity is an ongoing non-atomic execution within a state machine.

### Action
An action is an executable atomic computation that results in a change in the state of the model or the return of a value.


### Relationships

#### Associations	
- Indicate that instances of one model element are connected to instances of another model element
- Example: 
	- 1..1: Only one
	- 0..*: Zero or more
	- 1..*:one or more
#### Dependencies	
- Indicate that a change to one model element can affect another model element
#### Generalizations	
- Indicate that one model element is a specialization of another model element
#### Realization / Implementation	
- Indicate that one model element provides a specification that another model element implements
