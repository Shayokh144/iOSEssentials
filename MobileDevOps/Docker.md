# Docker
In simple terms, Docker is a software platform that simplifies the process of **building**, **running**, **managing** and **distributing** applications. It does this by virtualizing the operating system of the computer on which it is installed and running.

### Docker Host
The machine on which Docker is installed and running is usually referred to as a Docker Host or Host in simple terms.
